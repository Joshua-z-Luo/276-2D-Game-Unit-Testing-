INTRODUCTION
------------

TV Guy Escape is a simple 2D action maze chase game. In the game, you play as TV Guy who is a science experiment gone wrong and your goal is to escape the mad laboratory you were created in. To escape, you need to collect all three key cards on each level to be able to access the door the leads to freedom. Stopping his escape will be gaping holes in the floor and savage screwdrivers designed to chase you relentlessly and ensure that you get taken apart, but be warned your batteries arenâ€™t meant to last forever, so be sure to pick up some batteries along the way to keep you powered up!
